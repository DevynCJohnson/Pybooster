## Nano Initialization File
##
## To make sure an option is disabled, use "unset <option>"
##
## Quotes inside string parameters do not have to be escaped with backslashes
## The last double quote in the string will be treated as its end
## For example, for the "brackets" option, ""')>]}" will match ", ', ), >, ], and }.
